# React Project: Passing Thoughts

What if you could post something and know it wouldn’t live forever?  
In this project, we’ll build a place for our passing thoughts.  
Once you add a short thought, it’ll disappear after just 15 seconds.

### Available Scripts
Run `npm install` inside the project's root directory (make sure you have Node installed on your computer)

Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Open [https://passingthoughts-qnn.surge.sh/](https://passingthoughts-qnn.surge.sh/) to view it in deployed version.
